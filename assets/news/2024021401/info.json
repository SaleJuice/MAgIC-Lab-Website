    "description": "The papers entitled 'Adaptive neural network control of robotic manipulators with input constraints and without velocity measurements', has been accepted  by IET Control Theory & Applications. This paper addresses the trajectory tracking problem for a class of uncertain manipulator systems under the effect of external disturbances. Rigorous proof and experiments conducted on a rela manipulators are provided in the paper",
