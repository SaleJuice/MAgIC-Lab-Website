    "title": "Congratulations to MAgIC Lab for two papers accepted to SCL and EJC, respectively.",
    "description": "The papers entitled 'Robust output regulation for uncertain nonlinear minimum phase systems under unknown control direction' and 'Robust output regulation of a class of uncertain nonlinear minimum phase systems perturbed by unknown external disturbances' have been accepted to Systems & Control Letters and European Journal of Control. The former focuses on disturbance rejection for systems with unknown control direction, while the latter achieves exact reconstruction of unstructured disturbances and closed-loop stabilization. The proposed methods have potentials in controlling uncertain systems in a perturbed environment, such as active noise cancellation, and AC motor control. Anyone is welcome to discuss with us!",
